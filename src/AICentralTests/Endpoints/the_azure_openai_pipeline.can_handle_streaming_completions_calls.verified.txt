What are you currently working on?\n\nI am working on a few things at the moment. I am collaborating with my partner to set up a new theatre company (more to come on that), and I am writing a TV pilot about a black woman in her 40s who suddenly inherits a fortune and has to deal with the consequences of that. I am also working on a new play which is a bit of a departure for me",
