# Quickstart

## APIm Proxy with Cosmos Logging

### Use Case

- You are running an AI Platform with Azure API Management leveraging AI Gateway for load balancing, circuit breaking,
  quota, etc.
- You are using APIm products to reduce blast radius of changing API Management when onboarding new consumers.
- You want to restrict AOAI from accessing URLs provided in chat completion requests.
- You want to use managed identities and Entra, for the best security posture.

### AI Central Features

- AI Central will provide simple PII Stripped logging to a secure Cosmos Database.
- It will filter AOAI requests removing any URLs that could cause AOAI to fetch URLs and potentially leak data.

### Configuration

``` docker graemefoster/aicentral:latest ```

Set the following environment variables

> > ClaimsToKeys will have multiple values. Typically, we will map the appid of Managed Identities to a subscription
> > key.

> > This quickstart expects consumers to provide tokens scoped for Azure Open AI. You don't need to setup RBAC for your
> > consumers to Azure Open AI. Libraries like PromptFlow hardcode this scope, so that's why we look for it.
